        <h1>History of TMV</h1>
        <p>
          The origin of the Vidyapeeth dates back to the pre-independence period
          - 1921 when immediately after the demise of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar
          Tilak, his follower Mahatma Gandhi mooted the idea of establishing a
          university in his memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we all are aware one of the postulates of the four fold formula
          conceived by Lokmanya Tilak was National Education, the other three
          being Swaraj, Swadeshi and Boycott of Foreign Goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The delegates of the first Maharashtra Provincial Conference on 6th
          May 1921 under the Presidentship of Shrimat Shankaracharya of Karveer
          Peeth decided to have a National University in Maharashtra and thus
          the present day Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth (TMV) was established.
          Since it's inception, TMV, the public funded university had world
          renowned scholar Shri Shankaracharya Vidyashankar Bharati alias Dr.
          Kurtakoti as its first Chancellor.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          This post has been held by other eminent personalities of great
          intellect and recognition at the national level such as the great
          Sanskrit Scholar Bharatacharya Shri. C. V. Vaidya, the first premier
          of Bombay Presidency Shri. B. G. Kher, Dr. M. S. alias Lokanayak
          Bapusaheb Aney, a great Sanskrit scholar and a historian
          Mahamahopadhyay Datto Vaman Potdar, and Honorable Shri. Y. B. Chavan,
          Shri. S. B. Chavan, Shri. Shivraj Patil, Shri. Sushilkumar Shinde -
          all Union Home Ministers.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the pre-independence period, degrees awarded in the faculties
          of Arts, Management, Commerce and Engineering as well as the research
          works in Sanskrit and Ayurveda were world acclaimed and recognized.
          Similarly, in the post-independence period, the degrees of Tilak
          Maharashtra Vidyapeeth were equivalent to the degrees of other
          statutory universities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though late, it was only in the year 1987 that the University Grants
          Commission took cognizance of the significant work of TMV in the
          fields of Sanskrit, Ayurveda, Social Sciences and Distance Education
          and thereby on its recommendations, the Government of India conferred
          the "Deemed to be University" status upon Tilak Maharashtra
          Vidyapeeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this conferment of "Deemed to be University" status, the
          Vidyapeeth gained recognition at the national level. The concept of
          Non-formal Education was first discussed at the national level only in
          the year 1985 and thereby the TMV contributed to this national vision
          by launching distance education course (B.A.).
        </p>
        <p>
          TMV takes pride in the fact that the distance education programme was
          launched before to the establishment of IGNOU at national level and
          YCMOU at the state level. Since its founding, TMV had very rich human
          resources. However, being a public funded university, Vidyapeeth could
          not make any significant progress owing to financial constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that on one hand, the Vidyapeeth had limited resources and
          on the other hand less support was rendered by the Central/State
          Government. With the conferment of "Deemed to be University" status in
          1987, the Vidyapeeth received its first financial assistance for the
          development of campus during the last phase of the VIII Plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously the State Government also sanctioned a salary component
          for some teaching (17) and non-teaching posts (52). Since then the
          Vidyapeeth has also received financial support for development / the
          research purposes from UGC/State Government.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be noted that for smooth and efficient functioning of the
          Vidyapeeth, requisite teaching and non-teaching staff were employed
          from its own funds. Considerable research work has been conducted by
          the faculties of Sanskrit, Social Sciences and Ayurveda with its
          respective prime focus on -
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Promotion and protection of our great Indian heritage and tradition
            through the study of Sanskrit - the original source of all Indian
            languages and Sanskrit sources of Indian History;
          </li>

          <li>
            Application of the innovative concept of an interdisciplinary
            approach to emerging social issues and challenges; to create
            awareness among deprived sections of society;
          </li>

          <li>
            Impart Ayurvedic knowledge of preventive medicine and positive
            health to the masses in the context of oral prescriptions, a study
            of manuscripts to current trends in drugs and clinical trials.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Later in the year 2000, the Distance Education Council (DEC), New
          Delhi gave its recognition and offered financial assistance for
          Distance Education programmes. By the year 2004 there was a boom in
          the fields of computer and management and thereby the student strength
          of the Vidyapeeth for courses in these fields also increased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now with prime focus on its core fields viz. Sanskrit, Ayurveda and
          Social Sciences intact, Vidyapeeth re-oriented itself to offer new
          courses that cater to the student community and meet the demands of
          the industrial sector. By seeking requisite approvals from statutory
          councils - NCTE / AICTE / INC / MSCOTP and BCI the Vidyapeeth launched
          BHMCT / B.Sc. Nursing / BPT / LL.B. courses respectively.
        </p>
        <p>Vidyapeeth has always adhered to the MHRD/UGC/DEC guidelines.</p>

        <p>
          With regard to the UGC policy related to access, equity, quality,
          research and so on, the Vidyapeeth has always done its best to reach
          the unreached. Vidyapeeth has State-of-the-Art infrastructure
          facilities, requisite qualified and dedicated faculties and
          administrative staff along with allied facilities to foster a positive
          learning environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several eminent personalities such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal
          Nehru, Dr. Zakir Husain, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, Dr. Raghunath
          Mashelkar, Dr. Anil Kakodkar, Shri. Sharad Pawar, Shri. Pranab
          Mukherji and others during their visit to the Vidyapeeth campus have
          appreciated its uniqueness, amicable culture and rigorous research
          activities.
